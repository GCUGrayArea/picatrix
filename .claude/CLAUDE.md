## CRITICAL: Read Commit Policy

**Before making ANY commit, review `.claude/rules/commit-policy.md`**

Quick summary:
- Planning documents (task-list.md, PRD.md): Auto-commit immediately
- Everything else: Ask permission before committing

The full policy explains edge cases and provides examples. This rule exists to keep humans in control of implementation decisions while enabling fast agent coordination.
