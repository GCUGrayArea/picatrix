## CRITICAL: Read Commit Policy

**Before making ANY commit, review `.claude/rules/commit-policy.md`**

Quick summary:
- Planning documents (task-list.md, prd.md): Auto-commit immediately
- Everything else: Ask permission before committing

The full policy explains edge cases and provides examples. This rule exists to keep humans in control of implementation decisions while enabling fast agent coordination.

For coding tasks, review `,claude/rules/agent-defaults.md` as well for how to participate in this agent coordination.
