## CRITICAL: Read These First

### 1. Memory Bank - Read at Every Session Start

**Before starting ANY task, read these files in order:**

**Project Foundation (read first):**
- `docs/prd.md` - Project requirements and goals (generated by `/plan`)

**Work Coordination (read second):**
- `docs/task-list.md` - Current PRs and their status

**Implementation Wisdom (read third - all files in `docs/memory/`):**
- `systemPatterns.md` - Architecture decisions made during implementation
- `techContext.md` - Tech stack, setup, constraints discovered
- `activeContext.md` - Current work focus and recent changes
- `progress.md` - What actually works, known issues, status

Memory bank files are **agent working memory** - optimized for AI context, not human readability. They ARE committed to the repo so all users benefit from accumulated institutional knowledge.

See `.claude/rules/memory-bank.md` for complete instructions on when and how to update these files.

### 2. Commit Policy - NEVER COMMIT WITHOUT PERMISSION

**You may ONLY auto-commit these coordination files:**
- `docs/prd.md`
- `docs/task-list.md`
- `.claude/agent-identity.lock`
- `docs/memory/*.md` (all memory bank files)

**For ALL other files, you MUST ask permission first.** This includes:
- Implementation code (`.ts`, `.py`, `.rs`, `.go`, etc.)
- Tests (any file in `tests/`, `__tests__/`, `*_test.py`, etc.)
- Configuration files (`.json`, `.yaml`, `.toml`, `.env.example`, etc.)
- Documentation (`.md` files other than planning docs)
- Build files (`package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, etc.)

**When you complete work on a PR:**
1. Tell the user what files you've modified
2. Ask: "Would you like me to commit these changes?"
3. Wait for approval
4. Only commit after user says yes

**After user approves:**
```bash
# Commit implementation (user approved)
git add [files from your PR file list]
git commit -m "clear message describing changes"

# Auto-commit task list update
git add docs/task-list.md
git commit -m "[AgentName] PR-XXX: In Progress → Complete [files]"
```

**If you're about to commit non-coordination files without asking:**
1. **STOP**
2. Ask the user first
3. Wait for response
4. Only proceed if approved

No exceptions. See `.claude/rules/commit-policy.md` for edge cases and examples.

### 3. Agent Coordination

For coding tasks, review `.claude/rules/agent-defaults.md` for how to participate in this agent coordination system.

### 4. Coding Standards - ENFORCE STRICTLY

**All code must adhere to standards defined in `.claude/rules/coding-standards.md`**

Read and follow these standards when writing or modifying code. Proactively refactor to maintain compliance.

QC agents will flag standards violations as cleanup priorities.
