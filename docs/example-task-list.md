### PR-004: User Authentication Service
**Status:** Broken ‚ùå
**Dependencies:** PR-001, PR-002
**Priority:** HIGH (blocking PR-005, PR-006)
**Completed:** 2025-10-27 13:15 by [Blonde]
**Broken:** 2025-10-27 13:30 by [QC]

**Description:**
Implement JWT-based authentication with login, registration, and token refresh.

**Files:**
- src/auth/AuthService.ts (create)
- src/auth/jwt.ts (create)
- src/middleware/auth.ts (create)
- tests/auth/AuthService.test.ts (create)
- tests/auth/integration.test.ts (create)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] User registration with password hashing (bcrypt)
- [x] Login returns JWT access and refresh tokens
- [x] Token refresh endpoint
- [x] Auth middleware validates tokens
- [x] Unit and integration tests
- [ ] **FAILING:** Token refresh test

‚ùå **QC Failure Report:** (2025-10-27 13:30 by [QC])
```
Test Suite: AuthService
Status: 5 passing, 1 failing

FAILED: "should refresh expired access token with valid refresh token"
  Expected: HTTP 200 with new access token
  Received: HTTP 401 Unauthorized

Root Cause Analysis:
- Token refresh logic in AuthService.refreshToken() checks expiration
  with `<= expiryTime` instead of `< expiryTime`
- Tokens exactly at expiry timestamp are incorrectly rejected
- Edge case: tokens expiring at second boundaries always fail

Fix Location: src/auth/AuthService.ts:87
Change: expiresAt <= now  ‚Üí  expiresAt < now

Test Coverage: 87% (acceptable but has failing test)
Priority: HIGH - Blocks PR-005 and PR-006 which need authentication
```

**Original Completion Note:** (Blonde, 2025-10-27 13:15)
Implemented JWT auth with bcrypt password hashing. Access tokens expire
in 15min, refresh tokens in 7 days. All tests passing locally.

## Block 3: Frontend (Depends on Block 2) ‚è≥ WAITING

### PR-005: React Todo List Component
**Status:** Blocked-Ready
**Dependencies:** PR-003 (In Progress), PR-004 (Broken)
**Priority:** Medium
**Planned:** 2025-10-27 11:45 by [Blue]

**Description:**
Build React components for displaying and managing todo list. Include filtering,
sorting, and real-time updates.

**Files (VERIFIED during planning):**
- src/components/TodoList.tsx (create)
- src/components/TodoItem.tsx (create)
- src/components/TodoFilters.tsx (create)
- src/hooks/useTodos.ts (create)
- src/hooks/useAuth.ts (create)
- tests/components/TodoList.test.tsx (create)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Display todos with complete/incomplete states
- [ ] Filter by completed status
- [ ] Sort by date, priority
- [ ] Optimistic UI updates
- [ ] Loading and error states
- [ ] Responsive design (mobile-first)

**Planning Notes:** (Blue, 2025-10-27 11:50)
- Using React Query for data fetching and caching
- TailwindCSS for styling
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Estimated 2 hours, breaking into sub-tasks:
  - TodoList container (30min)
  - TodoItem component (20min)
  - Filtering UI (25min)
  - useTodos hook with React Query (30min)
  - Tests (15min)

**Blocked Reason:** (Blue, 2025-10-27 13:45)
Cannot start implementation:
- PR-003 (Todo API) is still In Progress - API contract not finalized
- PR-004 (Auth) is Broken - useAuth hook depends on working auth

Will resume when both dependencies are Complete.

### PR-006: User Login UI
**Status:** New
**Dependencies:** PR-004 (Broken)
**Priority:** Medium

**Description:**
Create login and registration forms with form validation and error handling.

- tests/components/LoginForm.test.tsx (create)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Login form with email/password
- [ ] Registration form with validation
- [ ] Display auth errors clearly
- [ ] Remember me functionality
- [ ] Redirect after successful login
- [ ] Form accessibility (WCAG AA)

**Notes:**
Blocked by PR-004 (Auth). Cannot estimate files accurately until auth
implementation is finalized. Will move to Planning when PR-004 is Complete.

## Block 4: Parallel Infrastructure ‚öôÔ∏è IN PROGRESS

### PR-007: Error Logging and Monitoring
**Status:** Suspended
**Dependencies:** PR-001

**Suspended:** 2025-10-27 11:30 by [Brown]

**Description:**
Set up error logging with Winston, integrate with error tracking service,
add request logging middleware.

**Files:**
- src/lib/logger.ts (create)
- src/middleware/requestLogger.ts (create)
- src/config/logging.ts (create)
- package.json (modify - add winston, morgan)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Winston configured with multiple transports (console, file)
- [ ] Request logging middleware
- [ ] Error levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- [ ] Integration with error tracking (Sentry/DataDog)

**Suspended Notes:** (Brown, 2025-10-27 11:30)
Completed sub-tasks:
- ‚úì Winston configured with console and file transports
- ‚úì Log levels and formatting set up
- ‚úì package.json updated with dependencies

Paused because:
- Need user input: which error tracking service to use (Sentry, DataDog, or Rollbar)?
- Don't want to add dependencies without confirmation
- Can resume in 15-20 minutes once user decides

Next steps when resuming:
- Add chosen error tracking SDK
- Configure middleware integration
- Write tests for logger
- Document logging patterns

**Identity Status:** Brown identity released 2025-10-27 11:30

### PR-010: Generate Architecture Documentation
**Status:** New
**Dependencies:** ALL PREVIOUS PRs (must be last)
**Priority:** Medium

Create comprehensive architecture documentation in `docs/architecture.md`
that serves as the definitive reference for the system's design, implementation,
and operational characteristics.

**Files (ESTIMATED):**
- docs/architecture.md (create)

**Documentation Requirements:**
- System architecture overview
- Technology stack and rationale
- Component architecture (Express routes, models, auth flow)
- Data models (User, Todo schemas with relationships)
- Key subsystems (Authentication flow with diagrams)
- Security architecture (JWT, password hashing, rate limiting)
- Deployment architecture (Node.js + SQLite, future multi-instance with Redis)
- Visual diagrams (Mermaid syntax for GitHub rendering)
- Performance characteristics

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Developer can understand system by reading this doc
- [ ] All architectural decisions documented with rationale
- [ ] Diagrams render correctly in GitHub

## Notes for Using This Example

This example demonstrates:

‚úì All PR statuses: New, Planning, Blocked-Ready, In Progress, Suspended, Complete, Broken
‚úì Multiple agents working in parallel with different colors (White, Orange, Pink, Blonde, Blue, Brown, QC)
‚úì File locking preventing conflicts (PR-005 can't start because PR-003 touches overlapping files)
‚úì QC agent testing and certification
‚úì Broken PR with detailed failure analysis
‚úì Suspended PR with resume instructions
‚úì Blocked-Ready PR waiting on dependencies
‚úì Agent identity claiming and releasing
‚úì Realistic timestamps and duration tracking
‚úì Progress notes showing sub-task completion
‚úì Critical path analysis
‚úì Summary statistics

This is what a real task-list.md looks like mid-project when multiple
agents are collaborating in parallel.
